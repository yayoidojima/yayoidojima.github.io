     <p>Somehow it is a more pleasing feeling to yearn for the love of my past than to have lost it completely. Now I feel empty and bereft of love. At least then I was still holding onto it. And hey-- don't take this as depression. In fact, the opposite. I am learning to live with myself better (though I still don't know how to love myself. I'm not quite sure what it means).</p>
     <p>Yet, in the end, I still feel "Let's get depressed", and I want to listen to some music that's made me cry. It was a moment of lonely weakness, crying over the fact that I was unloved. </p>
     <p>and for some reason I want to relive that. perhaps those were, ironically, easier times. </p>

    <p>manga is so much better than anime. lots more escapism to offer, though ofc more challenging immersion ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>

<p>hello</p>
<p>this is the first post on this page</p>
<p>go to https://komurokaede.carrd.co/ for some of my socials</p>
<p>anyways. im on HRT as of a few days ago. my mood has been changing for the better. i did a job interview today. hope i get the job so i can get the fuck out of shitsville NJ.</p>
<p>im learning to manage myself better. last night i thought to ease anxiety, "just gotta wake up at 9:30, do my Japanese lesson, then go to my job interview, get the job, and work for a few weeks and get paid. then i work another couple and get paid again, and repeat the process a few more times. then i put in my two weeks, buy an amtrak ticket, pack my shit and im out of here."</p>
<p>really putting yourself into perspective as if you're a movie character blowing through months in an on-screen time of 10 minutes, makes things much simpler. yeah, there will be times where I wake up and feel like dog shit, but thats where the willpower and coffee comes thru. weed though, i might drop it-- its pure escapism and i want to love this world. i dont even have friends, i get no dick, i sure as hell get no pussy, no hoes or bros, zilch. social life deader than the dodo bird. hopefully theres enough good movies out there to eat up my spare time.</p>
<p>i also reallllllly wanna get back into anime, but good grief i've already seen the peak of what there's to offer. super hard to find good anime when it's like you've seen em all. i genuinely don't get the mfs who just watch all the new seasonal shows-- i am not quite willing to dedicate my time to cringe-inducing trash, though, its extremely rare to find anything like that. maybe im just fuckin picky. either way. once i get this job-- racing sim rig. then im gonna drown hours of my life into Assetto Corsa, lol. and hopefully ill be able to finally make some fucking games, and begin my business. going to cleveland to meet up with my second-in-hand will surely allow this.</p>
<p>just spending a lot of time these days working on myself. we'll see how shit goes. what i have to do is NOT, and i mean **NOT** take shit slow. taking shit slow makes me want buckshot in my head. yeah the moment can be beautiful, but i dont even want to be in this fucking country! i want to be in japan. that is the dream, and its less of a dream than buying a fucking house-- its simply where i will begin the TRUE me, i sure hope. my TRUE life. god i cant wait, but now, if i just zoom through these days as best i can, i can get there soon.</p>
<p>i just wanna be there soon. "soon". the only thing thatll distract me from this yearning, craving, and anguish is love. hopefully ill find that soon, probs in cleveland. or i can just text my ex on instagram and embarass myself again. i dont know how she feels, but nobody has even looked at me the way she has, and nobody has produced the same feelings that she has too. well, she is a super old ex, so time's already moved on. i dont know though, maybe getting in contact again will be worth it. we'll see.</p>
<p>anyways for the rest of the night i just gotta cope with the random anxiety thats kicking in. hate this shit, kills the vibes and my mood. but im starting to hold this shit down, so ill learn :)</p>
<p>conclusively-- thanks for reading my first post, whoever you are. now you're pickin my brain. enjoy. have a goodnight yall.</p>
